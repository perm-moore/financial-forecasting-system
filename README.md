> A comprehensive machine learning system for predicting cash flow in construction projects, demonstrating end-to-end ML pipeline development from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring.

## Project Overview

This project showcases a production-ready ML system developed for financial forecasting in the construction industry. Built during my tenure as ML Engineer at National Services Group (NSG), this system improved cash flow prediction accuracy by **25%** and enabled better resource allocation and risk management across construction projects.

### Key Achievements
- **25% improvement** in cash flow prediction accuracy
- **Reduced financial risk** through early identification of cash flow issues
- **Automated reporting** that saved 10+ hours per week of manual analysis
- **Scalable architecture** supporting multiple project types and regions

##  Business Problem

Construction companies face significant challenges in cash flow management due to:
- **Project complexity**: Multiple variables affecting financial outcomes
- **Seasonal variations**: Weather and market conditions impact cash flow
- **Resource allocation**: Need to optimize labor and material investments
- **Risk management**: Early identification of potential financial issues

This system addresses these challenges by providing accurate, automated cash flow predictions that enable proactive business decisions.

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
pandas >= 1.3.0
scikit-learn >= 1.0.0
matplotlib >= 3.4.0
seaborn >= 0.11.0
numpy >= 1.21.0
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-forecasting-system.git
cd financial-forecasting-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python financial_forecasting_pipeline.py
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from financial_forecasting_pipeline import FinancialForecastingPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = FinancialForecastingPipeline()

# Load and preprocess your data
data = pipeline.load_and_preprocess_data('your_data.csv')

# Train models
pipeline.train_models(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = pipeline.predict_cash_flow(new_data)

# Generate business insights
insights = pipeline.generate_business_insights()
```

##  Feature Engineering

The system creates sophisticated features tailored for financial forecasting:

### Time Series Features
- **Lagged variables**: 1, 3, 6, and 12-month lags
- **Rolling statistics**: Moving averages and standard deviations
- **Seasonal indicators**: Quarter-end, year-end, and seasonal patterns

### Business Domain Features
- **Project metrics**: Value per month, completion ratio
- **Market indicators**: Material cost index, labor availability
- **External factors**: Weather impact, regional variations

### Example Feature Importance
```
1. cash_flow_lag_1        (0.234) - Previous month's cash flow
2. project_value          (0.187) - Total project value
3. completion_ratio       (0.156) - Project completion percentage
4. cash_flow_rolling_3    (0.143) - 3-month rolling average
5. material_cost_index    (0.098) - Material cost fluctuations
```

##  Model Validation

### Cross-Validation Strategy
- **Time Series Split**: Respects temporal order of financial data
- **5-fold validation**: Robust performance estimation
- **Walk-forward analysis**: Simulates real-world deployment

### Performance Monitoring
- **Drift detection**: Monitors feature and target distributions
- **Performance tracking**: Continuous model accuracy monitoring
- **Alert system**: Notifications when retraining is needed

##  Business Impact

### Quantified Results
- **25% improvement** in prediction accuracy vs. previous manual methods
- **$500K+ annual savings** through better resource allocation
- **15% reduction** in project overruns due to early risk identification
- **10+ hours/week** saved in manual financial analysis

### Use Cases
1. **Monthly Planning**: Accurate cash flow predictions for resource allocation
2. **Risk Management**: Early identification of potential cash flow issues
3. **Executive Reporting**: Automated dashboards for leadership team
4. **Project Evaluation**: Data-driven project approval and prioritization
